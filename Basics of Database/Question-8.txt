What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints

ANS----
      -------
            ------->>> SOL Key Constraints are rules that ensure the integrity and validity of the data within a database 
            by uniquely identifying records, enforcing relationships between tables, and maintaining consistency. 
            These constraints are applied to keys, which are specific columns in a table.



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Types of SQL Key Constraints: >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>




1. Primary Key (PK): Ensures that each record in a table is unique and cannot be NULL. 
A table can only have one primary key.



2. Foreign Key (FRK): Enforces a relationship between two tables. It ensures that the 
value in one table must match a value in another table.



3. Unique Key: Ensures that all the values in a column or a group of columns are unique, 
allowing NULL values (except in cases where NOT NULL, is also applied).


4. Candidate Key: Any column or set of columns that could qualify as a unique key but isn't the primary key.



5. Composite Key: A primary key made up of more than one column.

PRIMARY KEY:

CREATE TABLE Students (StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR (50), Age INT



FOREIGN KEY:

CREATE TABLE Enrolments (EnrollimentiDINT PRIMARY KEY, Studenti, CourseIDUNT, FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students StudentiD));


UNIQUE KEY:

CREATE TABLE Teachers (TeacherD INT PRIMARY KEY, Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE);



COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY:

CREATE TABLE Orders (OrderIDINT, ProductIDIT, Quantity, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID));



>> Explanation:

The Primary Key in the 'Students' table ensures that 'StudentID uniquely identifies each student and cannot be null.

The Foreign Key in the 'Enrollments' table links "StudentID' to the Students table, ensuring that any student enrolled 
exists in the "Students' table.
