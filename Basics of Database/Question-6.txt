6. What is DDL Interpreter?

==============================================================ANS===============================================================================

A DDL Interpreter is a component within a Database Management System (DBMS) responsible for interpreting and 
executing Data Definition Language (DDL) commands. These commands are used to define and manage the structure 
of a database, such as creating, altering, or deleting tables, indexes, and other schema objects.


Key Functions of a DDL Interpreter:



{1.}Interpreting DDL Commands:
The DDL interpreter translates high-level DDL commands (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP) written in SQL into 
low-level instructions that the database system can execute.


{2.}Managing Schema Definitions:
It helps manage database schemas by creating and modifying the structure of tables, defining relationships, 
and setting constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, etc.




{3.}pdating System Catalog:
Once a DDL command is executed, the DDL interpreter updates the system catalog (metadata) with information about 
the new or modified objects (e.g., tables, columns, data types).  


*****Example of DDL Commands:*******
CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE.
