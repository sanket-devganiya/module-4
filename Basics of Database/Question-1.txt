1. What do you understand By Database.

===================================================== Answer=====================================================================================

 *---A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. 
It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of information in a structured format.
Databases can store different types of data, such as text, numbers, images, and more, and are widely used in
applications ranging from websites to enterprise-level systems.

Key components and concepts related to databases include:

{1.Tables:} In relational databases, data is stored in tables 
made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, 
and each column represents a field within the record.


{2.Schema:} This is the structure that defines how the data is organized in the database,
including tables, fields, and relationships between them.


{3.Database Management System (DBMS):} A software that interacts with the database to manage, 
store, and retrieve data. Examples of DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB.


{4.SQL (Structured Query Language):} A language used to communicate with and perform operations on 
a relational database, such as querying data, updating records, or managing database structures.


{5.Indexing:} A technique used to speed up the retrieval of data by creating a structure that allows 
for faster searching.

{6.Normalization:} A process to organize data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.


{7.Transactions:} Operations that ensure data consistency, especially in multi-user environments, by grouping 
a set of database actions into a single unit.......
