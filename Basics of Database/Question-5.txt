5. What do you understand By Data Redundancy? 

=========================================================ANS=======================================================================================

Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data within a database or data storage system. 
It occurs when the same piece of data is stored in multiple places, leading to inefficiencies and 
potential problems in data management.


************************************************Key Points about Data Redundancy*****************************************************************

{1} Unnecessary Duplication:
--When the same data is repeated across multiple locations, it increases the amount of 
data stored unnecessarily.


{2.} problems with Inconsistency:
--when redundant data is updated in one place but not in others, it can lead to data inconsistency,
 meaning different copies of the same data might not match.


{3.} wasted Storage:
--Storing the same data multiple times consumes more storage space, leading to 
inefficient use of resources.


{4.} Maintenance Issues:
--Updating or deleting redundant data becomes complex and error-prone since all copies 
must be updated simultaneously to avoid inconsistency.
