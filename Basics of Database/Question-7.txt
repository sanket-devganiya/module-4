7. What is DML Compiler in SQL?

======================================================================ANS==========================================================================


A DML Compiler in SQL is a component of a Database Management System (DBMS) that processes Data Manipulation Language (DML) 
commands, such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT. These commands allow users to interact with and manipulate the data 
stored in the database.

*********************************************************Key Functions of a DML Compiler:********************************************************


{1.}Translating DML Queries:
The DML compiler translates high-level DML queries written in SQL into low-level instructions that the database can execute. 
These instructions are often in a form suitable for the query execution engine.



{2.}Query Optimization:
The DML compiler optimizes the execution of SQL queries by choosing the most efficient way to retrieve or modify the data. 
It uses query optimization techniques like indexing, join algorithms, and cost estimation.



{3.} Interacting with the Database:
After compiling and optimizing the DML statements, the DML compiler works with the database engine to perform 
the actual data manipulation tasks, such as fetching data or modifying existing records.



**************************************************Example of DML Commands:**********************************************************************

********INSERT*****---------------- Adds new records to a table.
********UPDATE*****--------------------------Modifies existing records.
********DELETE*****------------------------------- Removes records.
********SELECT*****------------------------------------- Retrieves data from one or more tables.
