What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

=================================================================ANS=============================================================================


1. Data Structure:
DBMS: Data is stored as files in a hierarchical or navigational form.
RDBMS: Data is stored in tables (rows and columns) where each table has a unique key, following the relational model.




2. Relationships Between Data:
DBMS: There is no relationship between the data; it lacks foreign keys or primary key relationships.
RDBMS: Data is related through foreign keys, and relational integrity is enforced using primary and foreign keys.




3. Normalization:
DBMS: Does not support normalization (organizing data to reduce redundancy).
RDBMS: Follows normalization principles, ensuring minimal redundancy and better data organization.




4. Data Integrity:
DBMS: Does not enforce data integrity constraints.
RDBMS: Enforces ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity.




5. Support for Complex Queries:
DBMS: Limited support for complex querying.
RDBMS: Provides support for complex queries using SQL (Structured Query Language).




6. Multi-user Access:
DBMS: Usually allows single-user access.
RDBMS: Supports multiple users accessing the database simultaneously with proper security mechanisms.



7. Examples:
DBMS: File systems, XML databases.
RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
